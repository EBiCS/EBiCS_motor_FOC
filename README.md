This firmware implements FOC motor control on a STM32F103 microcontroller. The code was written from scratch and is relatively simple to understand for developers.

The purpose of this repository FOC motor control code is [to be included as a library / git submodule on your project](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)!!

# How to use

See the example folder. In that example, a throttle is used to define the motor target current. Here a [video showing this example driving a Xiaomi EScooter M365 motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NelnB91Vqgw):<br>
